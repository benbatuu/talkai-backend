# TalkAI Backend

TalkAI is an innovative language learning platform that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized language practice experiences. Built with modern technologies and designed for scalability, TalkAI enables users to improve their language skills through AI-powered conversations, structured learning paths, and real-time feedback.

At its core, TalkAI utilizes Google's Gemini AI model to create intelligent language agents that understand context, maintain conversation flow, and adapt to each user's proficiency level. The platform employs a sophisticated architecture that combines TypeScript, Hono.js framework, and Prisma ORM to deliver a robust and performant backend system.

The application features a comprehensive authentication system with JWT-based security, role-based access control, and detailed user management. Integration with Stripe enables seamless subscription handling, allowing users to access premium features and personalized learning experiences. The platform's multi-language support system is designed to accommodate various language learning paths, with each language having its dedicated AI agent optimized for natural conversation flow and accurate feedback.

One of the key technical achievements of TalkAI is its custom-developed language-specific AI agents. These agents are fine-tuned to understand the nuances of each supported language, providing contextually appropriate responses and corrections. The system's modular architecture allows for easy integration of new languages and continuous improvement of existing language models.

The backend infrastructure is built with scalability and maintainability in mind, utilizing modern development practices and tools. With Hono.js as the core framework, the application delivers high-performance API endpoints, while Prisma ensures type-safe database operations and efficient data management. The system includes comprehensive logging, monitoring, and analytics capabilities to track user progress and system performance.
